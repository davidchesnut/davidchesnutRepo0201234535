# Update, unpublish, and view app and add-in metrics in the Seller Dashboard
Update your Office and SharePoint Add-ins and Office 365 web apps, unpublish (remove) them from Office Store listings and the Seller Dashboard, and view metrics in the Seller Dashboard.
After you submit your apps or add-ins to the Seller Dashboard, you might want to update them or remove (unpublish) them from Office Store listings. You can also delete your apps or add-ins from the Seller Dashboard. You can use metrics in the Seller Dashboard to evaluate how your apps and add-ins are performing.
